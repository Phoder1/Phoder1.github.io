  - I developed a game inside Road2's game acceleration program for 6 month.
  - I took part as a joint effort together with Code-For-Israel to create an educational game to be used as another tool by teachers to assess the mental state of students around Israel. The game is mainly used in more difficult areas, such as schools in proximity to Gaza.
