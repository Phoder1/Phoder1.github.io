Spacetaurant is a mobile, casual idle game combining management and gathering.  
The game is about running a futuristic and cute restaurant on a intergalactic highway.  
You play as the owner of the restaurant, who collects and grows ingredients to make sure all your customers leave your restaurant satisfied and hopefully leave you a good review.  

Spacetaurant was part of [R2G](https://www.road2.co.il/the-games-program/) - a game development acceleration program. 

R2G was created by a collaboration between:  
[Road2](https://www.road2.co.il/), a startup greenhouse funded by the Israel Innovation Authority.  
and [Tiltan](https://www.tiltan.co.il/), the college I study Game Development in.

Spacetaurant development had to be cut short because I wanted to focus on Phantom Beasts's development more and my producer got and investment in the the other indie game he was working on and had to start working there full time.

### My part in the project

Spacetaurant was a team of 3 people: I was the solo developer of the game, one was the game designer and producer and the 3rd was the artist of the game.
As the solo developer of the game I was in charge of designing and writing all the systems of the game, as well as tools to be used by the game designer.

### Highlights
- The idle nature of the game required offline systems to calculate how many customers arrived since the player last logged in.
- I created a versatile save system to save the data between each login of the player.
- I created a inventory, recipes and crafting system.
- Input system using Unity's new input system, with easy to change profile and aim assist.
