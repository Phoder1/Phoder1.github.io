### About the game
Co-Pirate is a multiplayer 2v2 pirates battle game all about sink-or-be-sunk, each team need to shoot cannon balls at the enemy team and fix holes in her own ship before it sinks.
Co-Pirate was the final project in my Multiplayer course, we used Photon Engine to make it.
### My part in the project
I was one of 3 developers working on the project, I was mainly in charge of the in-game mechanics and some multiplayer features.
