### About the game  
{{< img src="images/logo.png" height="100" float="right" title="Logo">}}
Paws Of Fury is a 2.5D mobile battle arena puzzle game. combines elements from tower defense, collectible card games and merging.

### My part in the project
Survive The Void was a team of 5 developers, which I was both lead developer and producer.
As the lead I had to divide the work, monitor the design process and implementation, but I also built most of the main systems of the game.

### Highglights
In Survive The Void I designed and built multiple systems with emphasis on object oriented:
- I built the world system, which was a optimized chunk based, infinite, randomly generated, dynamically loaded and serializable map system.
- Locomotion system with a custom collision system.
- Serializable and optimized time based event system to support huge amount of world time events.
