### About the game  
{{< img src="images/logo.png" height="100" float="right" title="Logo">}}
Paws Of Fury is a 2.5D mobile battle arena game, Where real-time strategy meets puzzle.
The game combines elements from tower defense, collectible card games and merging.

Paws Of Fury was made as my Production course project in my 2nd year.

### My part in the project
I was the solo developer of the game, and I built and designed all of the systems of the game.

### Highglights
Paws Of Fury development was focused on creating a game which feels complete, so many meta mechanics had to be created:
- Optimized and flexible save system.
- Player game progress with level, cards, coins and "goo".
- Card merging and rewards.
- Detailed card data with flexible UI.

Paws Of Fury wasn't lacking of in-game systems like:
- State-Machine based AI system.
- Flexible stats system to support multiple buffs and debuffs (like slow, attack speed, armor and many more), damage over time, heal, etc'.
- Advanced targeting system that's supports "ghost" and tank (taunt) characters, player targeting and different prioritizing rules per character like lowest-health-first, closest-first and many more.
- Tile based editor tool to easily create levels.
